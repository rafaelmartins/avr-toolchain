# avr-toolchain

crosstool-NG settings for a statically-linked AVR toolchain.

The toolchain includes GDB and patched avr-size, that shows program and data usage relative to the target microcontroller. It also includes support for the new AVR series of microcontrollers, and updated libraries for the older ones.
