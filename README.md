# avr-toolchain

AVR open source toolchain builds for Linux and Mac, including recent atpacks.

The toolchain includes `avr-gdb` and a patched `avr-size` binary that shows program and data usage relative to the target microcontroller. It also includes support for the new AVR series of microcontrollers, and updated libraries for the older ones.

Builds are generated using GitHub Actions infrastructure, using `crosstool-ng`.
